Changed in 0.8:
- Near complete rewrite of internals
- Parameters now have units, aliases, descriptions and references
- Strained alloy interface is much cleaner
  (see `examples/Strained_Ternaries`)
- Ternaries of ternaries are now possible
  (see `examples/Ternaries_of_Ternaries`)
- Alloy interpolation now follows the recommendations from
  Vurgaftman, et al. (2001).
- Added electron_affinity parameter
- Fixed Ternaries requiring lattice matching temperature

Changed in 0.7:
- Added several functions for calculating the effects of biaxial strain
- Added a strained binaries band offsets vs lattice constant example
- Added several advanced examples
- Fixed the strained binaries bandgap vs lattice constant
  example (the strain effects were reversed)
- Fixed bug with AlGaN, AlInN, and GaInN caused by having extraneous commas

Changes in 0.6:
- Fixed a packaging issue that prevented setup.py from working

Changes in 0.5:
- Lattice matching temperature is no longer required (defaults to 300 K)
- Added the heavy and light hole effective mass parameters
- Added some new example scripts
- Added quaternary bowing
- Adjusted the InAsSb VBO bowing parameter
- Added some literature references as comments
- Fixed examples not loading local openbandparams

Changes in 0.4:
- Added quaternaries
- Added strained binaries example
- Added 'elements' property and 'elementFraction' method
- Implemented __all__, so that 'from openbandparams import *' works
- Moved examples into the openbandparams package
- Lots of internal changes (refactoring, documentation, etc.):

Changes in 0.3:
- Added ternary lattice matching

Changes in 0.2:
- Improved usability of ternaries
- Changed all methods to require key word arguments
- Added documentation
