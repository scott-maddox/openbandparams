Installation
============

In order to use openbandparams, you must having a working python_ distribution installed. Python 3 support has not yet been tested, so Python 2.7 is suggested. There are several ways to install openbandparams:

1. Download the latest release `.zip` or `.tar.gz` source package from the `github page`_, extract its contents, and run "python setup.py install" from within the extracted directory (openbandparams is a pure-python library, so no compiling occurs during this installation).

2. Install from pypi_ by running "pip install openbandparams" from the command line.

Basic functionality has no prerequisites other than python, but several of the examples make use of numpy_ and matplotlib_, so you may want to install them, as well.

Once you have openbandparams installed, check out the :doc:`tutorial` to get acquainted.
